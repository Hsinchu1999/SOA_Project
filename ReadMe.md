# SOA Upstart Team Hsinchu1999 Project

## Idea: Travelling Suggestions

We will fetch hottest __tourist attractions__ from api and provide information about the spot (ex: wheather, transportation)

## API:

The APIs we currently using is the weather API from Central Weather Bureau (api url: https://opendata.cwb.gov.tw/api). The weather api provides us weather forecasts and historical records. These data are useful when giving tourism suggestions.
